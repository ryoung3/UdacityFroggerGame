<div>
This is my version of the classic frogger game. This project taught me a lot of advanced concepts about JavaScript & web development such as:
<ul>
<li>the 'this' keyword</li>
<li>pseudoclassical patterns</li>
<li>prototype chain</li>
<li>HTML5 canvas basics</li>
<li>closures</li>
<li>scope & much more ...</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="center"> How to Play </h2>
Simple, just use your up, down, left & right arrow keys to move your player. Try to cross the road without getting hit by one of the bugs ! If you successfully cross the road, the player will reset itself back to its starting position. Should you get hit by a enemy, your player will reset itself back to its starting position.
